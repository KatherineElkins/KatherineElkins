## 🔬 Research Focus

I study **information processing across political, economic, and cultural systems**—investigating how information flows shape human behavior, social outcomes, and institutional decision-making. My work combines computational methods with interpretive depth, bridging social science and humanities to tackle questions about AI governance, behavioral prediction, and cultural influence.

### Recent Projects

**Behavioral AI & Social Systems**
- **IBM-Notre Dame Tech Ethics Lab Grant ($60K)**: "How Well Can GenAI Predict Human Behavior?" 
  - Collaborated with Yong Suk Lee (Notre Dame) on auditing LLMs for behavioral prediction accuracy
  - Multi-agent debate frameworks for improved explainability and stability in high-stakes decisions
  - Examining FATE (Fairness, Accuracy, Transparency, Explainability) in social applications

**AI Governance & Policy**
- **AgenticSimLaw**: Computational approaches to AI alignment and policy simulation
- **Linguistic Hacking**: Security vulnerabilities in large language models
- **NIST AI Safety Institute**: Federal AI safety frameworks (Principal Investigator, representing MLA)

**Cultural & Political Analysis**
- **Archival Intelligence**: AI methodologies for cultural heritage preservation
- **GenAI for Narrative**: Metrics and evaluation of narrative generation across multiple scales
- **Hyperpersuasion**: Evaluating hyperpersuasion in models
- **Emotional Architecture**: Information processing in narrative, media, and social systems

## 🎓 Background & Approach

**Why Computational Social Science + Humanities?**

My training in comparative literature and humanities brings:
- **Interpretive depth**: Understanding how meaning-making shapes behavior (essential for studying misinformation, persuasion, political discourse)
- **Cultural sophistication**: Cross-cultural analysis skills that pure quant approaches miss
- **Narrative expertise**: How information structures influence decision-making in policy, economics, and social systems
- **Multilingual capacity**: Inform comparative policy and cultural analysis

**Academic Training**
- Ph.D., UC Berkeley 
- B.A., Yale University
- Nearly 9 years hands-on AI implementation research
- Expertise: NLP, AI audits, social network modeling

**Teaching Philosophy**
"Active engagement over passive critique" - Enable students to conduct cutting-edge computational research that tests theories across social sciences and humanities. Result: Globally downloaded research with real-world applications.

**Academic Leadership**
- Founded world's first human-centered AI Laboratory, KDH AI Lab (Kenyon College)
- Director, Integrated Program in Humane Studies (IPHS) - Kenyon's oldest interdisciplinary program
- Created first human-centered AI curriculum (2016)
