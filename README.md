# Katherine Elkins

**Professor of Comparative Literature & Humanities | AI Research Pioneer | Principal Investigator, NIST US AI Safety Institute**

## About Me

I develop computational methodologies that bridge artificial intelligence with humanistic inquiry, examining how AI systems understand and shape human emotion, creativity, and culture. With extensive hands-on experience in fine-tuning and model development, I've established foundational frameworks for analyzing narrative, cultural expression, and AI decision-making across diverse contexts‚Äîfrom literary texts to policy documents, from cultural heritage to platform governance.

As a professor at Kenyon College and founding co-director of the KDH Lab, my research spans computational humanities, AI governance, and ethical technology development. My work demonstrates that the most powerful AI applications emerge when we combine technical rigor with humanistic understanding.
