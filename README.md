## About Me

I investigate how artificial intelligence understands and shapes human emotion, creativity, and culture. With over six years of hands-on experience in fine-tuning and model development since GPT-2's release in 2019, I've established foundational methodologies that define how AI can analyze human narrative and cultural expression.

As a professor at Kenyon College and founding co-director of the KDH Lab, I work at the intersection of computational humanities, generative AI, and ethical technology development. My research bridges traditional literary scholarship with cutting-edge machine learning, creating new frameworks for understanding both human and artificial intelligence.

## üî¨ Research & Innovation

### Field-Defining Contributions

**SentimentArcs Methodology**  
Developed the first comprehensive methodology for using diachronic sentiment analysis to analyze emotional aspects of narrative structure, published in *The Shapes of Stories* (Cambridge University Press, 2022). This approach has been adopted globally to analyze:
- Literary texts and translations
- Television scripts
- Medical end-of-life narratives
- Social media discourse during elections and crises

**Human-Centered AI Curriculum**  
Co-created the world's first Human-Centered AI curriculum, launched at Kenyon College in 2016. This pioneering program integrates computational methods with humanities inquiry, preparing students to be thoughtful practitioners in our AI-driven future.

**Transdisciplinary AI Research**  
Among the first scholars to present AI research at leading humanities conferences:
- Modernist Studies Association (2019)
- International Society for the Study of Narrative (2020)
- Modern Language Association (2021)

### Current Research Focus

- Emotional manipulation detection in large language models
- AI's impact on authorship, creativity, and translation
- Explainable AI and bias detection
- Multi-agent debate frameworks for high-stakes decision contexts
- Cross-cultural narrative analysis using computational methods
