###BIO_LINKEDIN:

(https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate-elkins)

I investigate how artificial intelligence understands and shapes human emotion, creativity, and culture. As a pioneer in computational humanities and generative AI since GPT-2's release in 2019—with over six years of hands-on fine-tuning and model development—I've established foundational methodologies that define how AI can analyze human narrative and cultural expression.



As Principal Investigator for the NIST US AI Safety Institute and co-creator of the world's first Human-Centered AI curriculum (launched 2016), I bring unique insights developed through years of interdisciplinary research. I was among the first scholars to present transdisciplinary AI research at leading academic conferences, including the Modernist Studies Association (2019), International Society for the Study of Narrative (2020), and Modern Language Association (2021).



Featured expert on AI and creativity for Al Jazeera, Bloomberg Media, and international forums, my methodological innovations have been implemented across multiple research institutions globally. My recent $60,000 IBM-Notre Dame Tech Ethics Lab grant investigated how well generative AI predicts human behavior in high-stakes decision contexts. Through rigorous analysis of multi-agent debate frameworks, I demonstrated that these approaches achieve significantly superior stability and explainability compared to traditional methods.



Field-Defining Research:

Developed SentimentArcs methodology for narrative structure analysis (Cambridge UP 2022)—now used to analyze literature, translations, TV scripts, medical narratives, and social media

Pioneered emotional manipulation detection in large language models

Award-winning scholar in Comparative Literature with expertise spanning multiple languages and cultures

Established computational frameworks for cross-cultural narrative analysis



Proven Impact: Mentored 300+ researchers whose work has reached 75,000+ downloads globally. Selected for oral presentation at ICML 2024 (2% acceptance rate). Regular keynote speaker at major institutions.

Computing

Katherine Elkins works in both applied and theoretical humanities and social sciences with a focus on artificial intelligence, emotion, cognition, linguistics, ethics, and storytelling. She has published in both traditional humanities journals like Poetics Today, Narrative, PMLA, MLN, Philosophy and Literature and MLQ as well as in computing venues like Proceedings of ICML, Frontiers of Computer Science, the Journal of Cultural Analytics, the International Journal of Digital Humanities and the International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing. She is the editor of Oxford University Press's "Philosophical Approaches to Proust's In Search of Lost Time" and author of "The Shapes of Stories: Sentiment Analysis for Narrative" (Cambridge UP), in which she developed the first methodology to surface emotional arc for narrative. 

In 2016 she co-developed the first human-centered AI curriculum and co-founded Kenyon's AI Lab. Recipient of Kenyon’s Senior Trustee Teaching Award, she was awarded an NEH Teaching Professorship for curriculum innovation and became one of the first in the world to advocate for leveraging AI in the service of humanities and social science research. Since then she has given over a dozen keynotes and appeared in various media outlets, where she talks about both the risks and opportunities of generative AI. 

She is a member of Meta's Open Innovation AI Research Community, the multi-national group Public AI, Women in AI, and AI in Education. She has also served as co-PI representing the Modern Language Association for the U.S. AI Safety Institute and for the IBM/Notre Dame Tech Ethics Lab. Her passion is supporting voices in AI and computing that are typically underrepresented, and she has mentored over 300 AI/ML student research projects that have been downloaded tens of thousands of times from digital Kenyon by over a thousand institutions in over one hundred countries.

Courses Recently Taught

Programming Humanity

IPHS 200

This course equips students with computational methods spanning the humanities, social sciences, and data science. Through Python programming, data visualization, and modeling, students analyze everything from literary texts to social networks. The course examines how digital tools transform our understanding of human behavior and society while tackling crucial questions about AI, surveillance, automation, and transhumanism. By combining quantitative methods with critical analysis, the course prepares students to both understand and shape our increasingly algorithmic world. This course serves as the gateway course in the IPHS AI curriculum. We recommend that students without prior data science or programming experience take this course before enrolling in more advanced AI courses. \n\n

Cultural Analytics

IPHS 290

Cultural analytics is the study of culture using diverse sources and data-driven methods. We analyze language from texts to tweets and social networks from film to the Twitterverse. In this project-based course, students code ways to explore phenomena like the social networks in "Game of Thrones" and the classification of tweets as Trump or Trudeau. They apply what they have learned for a final project of their choice. Students new to coding should contact the instructor for information on how to complete a self-paced mini coding course before the start of the semester. This course does not count toward the completion of any diversification requirement. No prerequisite. Offered every other year.

AI for Humanity

IPHS 300

This course explores artificial intelligence through both technical implementation and humanistic inquiry. Building on the programming foundations from IPHS 200, students learn to build and critically evaluate AI systems, from classical machine-learning approaches to cutting-edge deep neural networks and large language models. Through hands-on projects, students create AI systems that generate music, analyze text, classify images and more. The course pairs technical training with readings from philosophy, ethics and critical theory to examine fundamental questions about creativity, intelligence, and what it means to be human in an age of artificial minds. The course emphasizes both technical competency and critical thinking, preparing students to be thoughtful practitioners and critics in our AI-driven future. Prerequisite: programming experience (such as IPHS 200); students implement machine learning models and work with industry-standard AI tools.

Senior Research Seminar

IPHS 484

This course, designed as a research and/or studio workshop, allows students to pursue their own interdisciplinary projects. Students are encouraged to take thoughtful, creative risks in developing their ideas and themes. Those engaged in major long-term projects may continue with them during the second semester. This course does not count toward the completion of any diversification requirement. No prerequisite. Junior standing.

Individual Study

IPHS 493

Individual study in the Integrated Program in Humane Studies is reserved for juniors and seniors who have completed at least one course in the program. Individual study projects are designed to offer the opportunity for directed reading and research in areas not generally covered by the regular offerings of the program, or by the regular offerings of other programs or departments. Alternatively, such projects may offer the opportunity for more advanced research in areas already addressed in program offerings. In some instances, they may offer the possibility of studying languages not otherwise available, or not available at an advanced level, in the College curriculum (e.g., Old Icelandic, Old English). Students undertaking an individual study project are expected to meet with their advisors on a regular basis, ordinarily at least once a week. Individual study projects are expected to embody a substantial commitment of time and effort, which, at the discretion of the project advisor, may result in a major essay or research report. Students wishing to undertake such a project should first gain, if possible a semester in advance, the permission of a potential advisor or mentor and then submit a written prospectus of the project for the approval of both the prospective advisor and the program director. Because students must enroll for individual studies by the end of the seventh class day of each semester, they should begin discussion of the proposed individual study by the semester before, so that there is time to devise the proposal and seek departmental approval. This course does not count toward the completion of any diversification requirement.

Katherine Elkins is professor of humanities and comparative literature and faculty in Computing at Kenyon College.

Early life

Elkins attended Yale as an undergraduate, then completed a Ph.D. at UC Berkeley. She is the niece of Henry Elkins.[citation needed]

Teaching

Elkins is a professor of comparative literature and humanities in the Integrated Program for Humane Studies (IPHS)[1] and faculty in Computing[2] at Kenyon College. She is a founding co-director of the KDH lab[3] and co-created the first human-centered artificial intelligence[4] curriculum launched in 2016 at Kenyon College[5] as the director of IPHS. She has mentored and co-authored hundreds of student ML/AI research projects in the humanities, arts and social sciences that have been downloaded almost 60,000 times worldwide as of September 2024.[6] Her recorded lectures with The Modern Scholar on The Modern Novel[7] (2021) and The Giants of French Literature[8] (2020) are tailored to broader public audiences via Amazon's Audible.com.[9] She was nominated by graduating seniors to give the Kenyon College's December 2024 Baccalaureate Address which revisited David Foster Wallace's famous 2005 "This is Water" Kenyon graduation speech.[10]

Research

Elkins is best known for her pioneering work on interdisciplinary artificial intelligence in literature, narrative, affective computing and the ethics of AI. Her book The Shapes of Stories, published by Cambridge University Press in 2022,[11] provided a comprehensive methodology for using diachronic sentiment analysis to analyze the emotional aspects of plot across dozens of literary classics using SentimentArcs.[12] This method has been used to analyze narrative in diverse forms including literature,[13] translations,[14] TV scripts,[15] end of life medical narratives,[16] and the evolution of social media narratives for elections[17] and economic crisis.[18]

She presented the first transdisciplinary AI research at leading academic conferences including the Modernist Studies Association in October 2019,[19] The International Society for the Study of Narrative in March 2020[20] and the Modern Language Association Conference in January 2021.[21] Elkins was an early advocate for incorporating AI in literary studies with co-authored essays in The Journal of Cultural Analytics in September 2020[22] and Narrative in January 2021.[23] More recently she focused on how AI redefines writing,[24] creativity,[25] authorship,[26] translations of literature,[27] eXplainable AI,[28] and the future of the academia in leading journals like Poetics Today.[29] Her article "A(I) University in Ruins: What Remains in a World with Large Language Models?" in the Proceedings of the Modern Language Association addresses how AI may fundamentally redefine traditional academic disciplines.[30] Her collaborative position paper addressing the risks and benefits of open-source AI was selected for oral presentation at ICML in July 2024.[31]

Elkins traditional scholarship includes essays on Plato,[32] Virginia Woolf,[33] Franz Kafka,[34] Marcel Proust,[35] and William Wordsworth.[36] In 2001 she won the A. Owen Aldridge Prize[37] in Comparative Literature for an essay on Charles Baudelaire.[37] She edited Philosophical Approaches to Proust’s In Search of Lost Time, which brings together essays by leading international Proust scholars, with Oxford University Press in 2022.[38]

Speaking

Elkins is one of the leading women speaking widely on interdisciplinary AI. As early as 2019, she publicly advocated integrating AI into traditional humanities curriculum with a keynote address at the Ohio State University.[39] She gave the Meredith-Donovan lecture at Mount Saint Mary's University in 2023,[40] featured AI Working Group lecture at Wofford College,[41] and presentation at the Stories that Win Symposium at Washington University in 2024.[42] Elkins gives keynotes on the intersection of AI, digital humanities, education, and the future of work. Most recently, in the summer-fall of 2024, these included keynotes at Carleton College's Day of Digital Humanities,[43] Lafayette College AI Literacy Across the Curriculum,[44] and Austin College's A.J. Carlson Lecture.[45] She will present on "How agentic behavior, reasoning, and emotional intelligence upend previous notions of human exceptionalism" for the Khan Institute at Smith College in February 2025.[46]

Elkins has been a co-panelist on interdisciplinary AI conversations with thought leaders from diverse fields. She discussed language, epistemology and the ethics of AI with Ned Block, Francesca Rossi, and Dennis Yi Tenen[47] in October 2022.[48] Elkins debated AI generative art with co-panelist Boris Eldagsen (winner[49] of Sony World Photography Award 2023) and Shane Balkowitsch on Al Jazeera in April 2023.[50] She presented her perspectives on emotions at the intersection of AI and literature with experts Rosalind Picard, Joseph LeDoux, and Mabel Berezin.[51] She discussed what gets lost in machine translation on the podcast Merging Minds.[52]

She is the AI industry expert for Bloomberg's new AI Strategy Course[53] launched 2024. She serves as CAIO[54] of HumanCentricLabs[55] emphasizing humane applications of AI in the workplace.

Collaborations

Kenyon College awarded Elkins the senior trustee teaching award In 2014.[56] In March 2024 she was named a principal investigator for NIST's US AI Safety Institute[57] representing the Modern Language Association.[58] She was awarded a Notre Dame-IBM Tech Ethics Lab[59] award in April 2024 to research the ethics and performance of SOTA LLM models to predict criminal recidivism.[60] Elkins has been a member of Meta's Open Innovation AI Research Community[61] since 2023 and will present at the 2024 Conference at Meta's London Office in October.[62] In January 2025, Elkins presented her grant research finding on LLM predictive policing at Notre Dame.[1]
